## Current Status

Based on the latest deployment logs:
- ✅ **Build command**: Now using correct `pnpm nx build web --skip-nx-cache`
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Installing successfully
- ❌ **Error**: `Cannot find configuration for task web:build`

The error suggests Nx plugins aren't initializing properly on Vercel. The build target is auto-generated by `@nx/next/plugin` but may need explicit definition.

## Dashboard Access

You can also check status in the Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. View the "Deployments" tab
4. Click on any deployment to see details and logs
